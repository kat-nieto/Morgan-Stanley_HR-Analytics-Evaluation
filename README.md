## The Company:

Company ABC is a mid-sized international software company with roughly 30,000 employees across 8 countries. They are known for having a diverse workforce, creating reliable products, and providing excellent customer service.

## Situation:

Like many companies, Company ABC is finding it difficult to navigate the long-term effects of the COVID pandemic on its workforce. For the first year, overall employee satisfaction was high – most likely as a result of how transparent and thoughtful the company was being towards employee wellbeing. But now as things begin to settle, CHRO Nadine Cook is concerned the company is falling prey to the “Great Resignation” after receiving word of termination after termination.
